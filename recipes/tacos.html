            day of the week.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds (680 grams) chicken breasts skinless boneless</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ yellow onion minced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup (130 grams) salsa</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Poach chicken. Place chicken in a saucepan, and cover with water. 
                Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for 10-12 minutes 
                or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F/74°C. 
                I use the kitchen thermometer to check as overcooked chicken will 
                be dry.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board or bowl, and shred it 
                with 2 forks.</li>
            <li>In a skillet, heat oil and sauté the onion until it’s soft and 
                translucent (3 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, and sauté for 30 seconds. Add cumin, oregano, 
                chili powder, and salt. Cook for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>Add salsa, and just mix it in (if necessary, you can add a splash 
                of water) and let it warm up.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, and mix it in with the sauce. Simmer for 2-3 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve in warmed up tortillas or taco shells with your favorite 
                toppings.</li>
        </ol>
